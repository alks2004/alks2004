 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alks2004
I got interested in programming a short time ago
and I tried to improve myself in it in a short time,
I learned by myself on an old computer and little by little 
I managed to advance. I'm 17 years old and I'm in high school.
I'm looking to improve myself in Python and soon be a great programmer like my sister.
I want to be collaborating with a company that understands and values 
â€‹â€‹me as a woman and person and I'm ready to learn more from my team.
